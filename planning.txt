Thoughts before starting:

Classes for
    Rover (Extending abstract Vehicle?)
    Plateau (Added plateauSize)
    Interface / UserInterface (likely going to split this out into input parsing and ui)
        Input parsers split out into own package with separate class for setup and then instructions
    Logic

Consideration (Beyond MVP)
    Allow user to input an invalid instruction and then prompt them to either cancel or perform a truncated version
        (Need input checking on logic?)

Where does the logic sit for checking if a move is valid.
    On the Plateau and gets called by the CommandCentre?




Using abstract class Vehicle so that Plateau can ultimately have an array of Vehicles.
Behaviours (move, photo, dig, wave) will be dictated by interfaces)
Vehicle should be able to reportPosition
