Thoughts before starting:

Classes for
    Rover (Extending abstract Vehicle?)
    Plateau
    Interface / UserInterface
    Logic

Consideration (Beyond MVP)
    Allow user to input an invalid instruction and then prompt them to either cancel or perform a truncated version
        (Need input checking on logic?)
