Thoughts before starting:

Classes for
    Rover (Extending abstract Vehicle?)
    Plateau (Added plateauSize)
    Interface / UserInterface (likely going to split this out into input parsing and ui)
    Logic

Consideration (Beyond MVP)
    Allow user to input an invalid instruction and then prompt them to either cancel or perform a truncated version
        (Need input checking on logic?)
