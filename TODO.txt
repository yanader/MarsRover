TODO

biggest priority: create better separation between programme flow and ui


-) remove vehicle from surface
-) clean up text displays to user
-) clean up "status" of a vehicle that print position/directional position but take it from the position (toString)
-) Interface Scannable with a class that can scan for resources
-) Clean up the way I am checking that a class implements an interface
    currently just checking against .getInterfaces()[0] which isn't scalable
    once we have a vehicle that implements two interfaces.
-) refactor everything
