TODO
-) new vehicle type (with Diggable) interface
-) Plateau.getVehicles() - use this to allow the commandcentre to
    offer an option for the user to pick a vehicle to control
-) CommandCentre to allow ui options to dig. (Might be straightforward - need to double check access modifiers)
-) CommandCentre.chooseOption()
    This will allow the user to choose between moving the active vehicle, swapping vehicles or landing another vehicle
-) remove vehicle
-) Interface Scannable with a class that can scan for resources
