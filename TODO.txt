Done
-) MVP achieved
-) README
-) Implement truncation of instructions
-) In command-centre - drop vehicle needs to ask for the type of vehicle to drop
-) On landing a new vehicle, check the space is empty
-) new vehicle type (with Diggable) interface (branch -Miner)
-) implement activate vehicle.
-) Plateau.getVehicles() - use this to allow the command-centre to
    offer an option for the user to pick a vehicle to control
-) CommandCentre.chooseOption()
    This will allow the user to choose between moving the active vehicle, swapping vehicles or landing another vehicle

NEXT

-) CommandCentre to allow ui options to dig. (Might be straightforward - need to double check access modifiers)
This works but the UI options surrounding it, text outputs and Help need updating
CLEAN UP USER INTERFACE -- too much text


-) merge Miner branch to main - do this before refactoring?


TODO

-) remove vehicle
-) Interface Scannable with a class that can scan for resources
-) refactor logic around checking movement instructions/offering truncated instructions (too much repetition)
-) refactor everything
